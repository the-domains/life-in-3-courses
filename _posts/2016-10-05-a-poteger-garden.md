  Potagers are French styled kitchen gardens that combine flowering ornamental
  plants with those grown for vegetables, fruits and herbs. A potager should be
  designed to please all the senses so it should be beautiful as well as
  functional. Most every French household, regardless of space constraints has a
  little potagerâ€¦.GL and I have had a potager for most of our married life. They
  have ranged in size from a few small pots on a ledge to full gardens with
  walking paths. We live in a condo in San Diego now and have placed our garden
  in pots around the outside of our home. Plenty of space to grow
  lavender,tomatoes, basil, peppers, geraniums, lettuce, cucumbers and our small
  orange and lime trees. How does your garden grow? We would love to see
  pictures and hear stories of your potager.
