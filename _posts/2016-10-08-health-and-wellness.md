  There comes a time in your life when your body begins to rebel against excess
  and neglect. Over the last few years my health declined to such a degree that
  when I wasn't working I was bedridden. Fibromyalgia, auto-immune disorder, and
  the inevitable depression that comes with these types of illnesses had made me
  a prisoner in my own body. I gained over 50 pounds and continued to decline. I
  finally came to the end of my rope. I could either quite my job and be fully
  disabled or I could take charge of my life. I decided I wasn't quite ready to
  give up on life.

There comes a time in your life when your body begins to rebel against excess and neglect. Over the last few years my health declined to such a degree that when I wasn't working I was bedridden. Fibromyalgia, auto-immune disorder, and the inevitable depression that comes with these types of illnesses had made me a prisoner in my own body. I gained over 50 pounds and continued to decline. I finally came to the end of my rope. I could either quite my job and be fully disabled or I could take charge of my life. I decided I wasn't quite ready to give up on life.

The first change was to rearrange my work schedule. For over 5 years I had been commuting almost 200 miles per day. In southern California that translates into 1.5-3 hours one way depending on traffic. That was in addition to my 10-12 hour work day. I went to my Dean (I work at a University) and asked if I could work from a local campus a few days a week as a trial. Surprisingly she agreed and so I cut my commute down to 2 days per week to our main campus and began to use our IM and video chat technology with my staff to stay in touch.

Next I took my doctors referral and entered into an integrated wellness program that centered around weight loss. It is a radical program of liquid diet and 2.5 hour meetings with doctors, therapists (both physical and psychological) which again required Monday mornings away from the office. I explained the situation to my Dean and again, she agreed to the 20 weeks needed to commit to the program. If I hadn't been so desperate I would never have asked for this kind of arrangement but it showed me that the worst that can happen is someone says no. the best is that you can arrange your life in a way that makes sense as long as you continue to contribute.

As of today I am 7 weeks in and have lost 26 pounds. I am beginning a reasonable exercise program that is helping to bring my body back to life and am happy to report that I have been pain free for 4 weeks.

I will continue to share my journey toward health and well being in these blog posts. But I would encourage you not to wait on your health. Make this your year to be well both physically and mentally. Don't wait to make changes now is your time, our time. Don't miss out!
