            <title><![CDATA[A Poteger Garden]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Poteger Garden</h1><p>Potagers are French styled kitchen gardens that combine flowering ornamental plants with those grown for vegetables, fruits and herbs. A potager should be designed to please all the senses so it should be beautiful as well as functional. Most every French household, regardless of space constraints has a little potagerâ€¦.GL and I have had a potager for most of our married life. They have ranged in size from a few small pots on a ledge to full gardens with walking paths. We live in a condo in San Diego now and have placed our garden in pots around the outside of our home. Plenty of space to grow lavender,tomatoes, basil, peppers, geraniums, lettuce, cucumbers and our small orange and lime trees. How does your garden grow? We would love to see pictures and hear stories of your potager.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/996c34de-cc66-457a-8ba9-5b8535e50d82.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Health and Wellness]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Health and Wellness</h1><p>There comes a time in your life when your body begins to rebel against excess and neglect. Over the last few years my health declined to such a degree that when I wasn't working I was bedridden. Fibromyalgia, auto-immune disorder, and the inevitable depression that comes with these types of illnesses had made me a prisoner in my own body. I gained over 50 pounds and continued to decline. I finally came to the end of my rope. I could either quite my job and be fully disabled or I could take charge of my life. I decided I wasn't quite ready to give up on life.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8ab85dec-125a-44f8-949b-8cb869358911.jpg"></article>]]></description>
